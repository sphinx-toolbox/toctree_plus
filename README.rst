This idea has been suggested in `sphinx-doc/sphinx#6316`_ and `sphinx-doc/sphinx#6435`_

You can see ``toctree-plus`` in action in `this project's documentation`_,
and the documentation for domdf-python-tools_ (ReadTheDocs Sphinx Theme) and whey_ (Furo Sphinx Theme).

Installation
--------------

.. start installation

``toctree_plus`` can be installed from PyPI or Anaconda.

To install with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python -m pip install toctree_plus

To install with ``conda``:

	* First add the required channels

	.. code-block:: bash

		$ conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge
		$ conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/domdfcoding

	* Then install

	.. code-block:: bash

		$ conda install toctree_plus

.. end installation

Enable ``toctree_plus`` by adding ``"sphinxcontrib.toctree_plus"`` to the ``extensions`` variable in ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

	extensions = [
		...
		"sphinxcontrib.toctree_plus",
		]

For more information see https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html#third-party-extensions .

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is currently only a single configuration option: ``toctree_plus_types``.
This determines the directive types that appear in the toctree. The default value is ``{"class", "function", "method"}``.
